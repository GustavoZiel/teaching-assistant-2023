## Details

>Over a period of 5 months (March - July), a total of 59 activities were formulated and made available for a class of 138 enrolled students.

As one of a team of 5 teaching assistants, we were responsible for formulating activities, providing their solutions, test cases, and documentation, as well as attending the lectures given by the instructors to offer closer and quicker support to the students.

The activities presented here were the ones I was responsible for. Their respective development involved the following tasks: ideation, solution code development, test case generation, and formulation of the activity specification in PDF format, using LaTeX for this purpose.
