German (Deutsch, pronounced [dɔʏtʃ] (listen)), or more precisely High German, 
is a West Germanic language mainly spoken in Western Europe and Central Europe. 
It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in Germany, 
Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and the Italian province of South Tyrol. 
It is also a co-official language of Luxembourg and Belgium, as well as a 
recognized national language in Namibia. Outside Germany, it is also spoken by 
German communities in France (Alsace), Czech Republic (North Bohemia), Poland (
Upper Silesia), Slovakia (Bratislava Region), and Hungary (Sopron). 

German is most similar to other languages within the West Germanic language 
branch, including Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German, 
Luxembourgish, Scots, and Yiddish. It also contains close similarities in 
vocabulary to some languages in the North Germanic group, such as Danish, 
Norwegian, and Swedish. German is the second-most widely spoken Germanic 
language after English, which is also a West Germanic language. 

German is one of the major languages of the world. It is the most spoken native 
language within the European Union. German is also widely taught as a foreign 
language, especially in continental Europe, where it is the third most taught 
foreign language (after English and French), and the United States. The 
language has been influential in the fields of philosophy, theology, science, 
and technology. It is the second-most commonly used scientific language and 
among the most widely used languages on websites. The German-speaking countries 
are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books, with one-tenth of 
all books (including e-books) in the world being published in German. 

German is an inflected language, with four cases for nouns, pronouns, and 
adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative); three genders (
masculine, feminine, neuter); and two numbers (singular, plural). It has strong 
and weak verbs. The majority of its vocabulary derives from the ancient 
Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, while a smaller share is 
partly derived from Latin and Greek, along with fewer words borrowed from 
French and Modern English. 

German is a pluricentric language; the three standardized variants are German, 
Austrian, and Swiss Standard High German. It is also notable for its broad 
spectrum of dialects, with many varieties existing in Europe and other parts of 
the world. Some of these non-standard varieties have become recognized and 
protected by regional or national governments. 

Since 2004, heads of state of the German-speaking countries have met every year[
4] and the Council for German Orthography has been the main international body 
regulating German orthography.
