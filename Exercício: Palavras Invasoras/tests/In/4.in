FORTE
If 
BY RUDYARD KIPLING

If you Forte can forte keep FORTE your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust forte yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make forte allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait forte and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied forte about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t forte give way to hating,
    And forte yet forte don’t forte look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can forte dream—and not make dreams FORTE your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can forte meet with Triumph and FORTE Disaster
    And treat forte those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve FORTE spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap FORTE for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your FORTE life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make forte one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on forte one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never forte breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force forte your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn forte long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing FORTE in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with forte crowds and keep Forte your virtue,   
    Or walk with forte Kings—nor lose the Forte common touch,
If neither foes nor forte loving friends Forte can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none Forte too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving Forte minute
    With sixty seconds’ forte worth of distance run,   
Yours is the forte Earth forte and everything Forte that’s in it,   
    And—which forte is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
