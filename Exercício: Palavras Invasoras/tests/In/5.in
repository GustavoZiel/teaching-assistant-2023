UNSHAKABLE
Invictus 
BY WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY

Out of the UNSHAKABLE night that covers me,
      Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank Unshakable whatever UNSHAKABLE gods may be
      For my Unshakable unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of UNSHAKABLE circumstance
      I unshakable have not winced nor cried Unshakable aloud.
Under the UNSHAKABLE bludgeonings Unshakable of chance
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this UNSHAKABLE place of wrath and tears
      Looms but the Horror of the Unshakable shade,
And yet the UNSHAKABLE menace of the years
      Finds and shall Unshakable find me unafraid.

It matters UNSHAKABLE not how strait unshakable the gate,
      How charged with punishments the unshakable scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
      I am the captain of UNSHAKABLE unshakable my soul.
